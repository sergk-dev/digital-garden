Hi, I'm Sergey, a full stack developer. 
I work as a programmer five days a week at a major agro-industrial holding. In my free time, I dedicate myself to several projects aimed at helping those in need. 
I also write articles on cloud development for Habr and my own blog.

## What's the point of blogging?

Though I recently started learning modern cloud technologies, I had a colleague who interrupted me while discussing these technologies and said that Kubernetes was too advanced for him, and he hadn't reached that topic yet because it seemed too complex. It reminded me of a few years ago when I had no basic knowledge of existing programming technologies. I searched the internet for articles on Kubernetes, and one after another, I felt left behind and foolish because most of them were written for those who already had experience with the system. I was frustrated because none of them answered the questions of "what is it?", "why would you use it?", "what purposes does it serve?", and "how do you start developing such systems?", instead bombarding me with technical information that overwhelmed me at the time. I didn't know how to escape this stale state and engage in interesting and productive work with new technologies. I couldn't even grasp the range of tools and directions available, so I couldn't choose one thing to focus on and narrow down my search.

Luckily, Coursera came to my rescue when I stumbled upon a full stack developer specialization that offered a broad overview, covering everything from Git to microservices. As I progressed through the courses in this specialization, I gained deep and solid skills in each of the technologies. The cloud development world, which seemed like a jumble of hundreds of incomprehensible English words, transformed into a clear picture. What I once considered incredibly complex suddenly became simple, convenient, and open to experimentation and further exploration. Instead of generating fear, my mind shifted into generating ideas. The most appealing ideas formed several projects that could help people.

In this blog, I have decided to try my best to explain what I have learned in the simplest way possible. I hope it can help those who, like me, have been hesitant to delve into cloud programming for a long time because everything seems too complex to move beyond the "Hello, World!" stage in Python.

## What kind of stuff do you find here?

I will start with a series of articles, and then we'll see how it goes from there.
